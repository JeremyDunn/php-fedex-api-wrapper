                must assign the same Manifest Id to each SmartPost package as determined by its trailer.  In other words, all packages on a trailer must have the same Customer Manifest Id. The manifest Id must be unique to your account number for a minimum of 6 months

                the 3 manifest ids would be 041001, 041002, 041003 (in this case we used leading zeros on the trailer numbers).
